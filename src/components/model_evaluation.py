"""
This code snippet is part of a model evaluation process where a trained machine
learning model is evaluated against a model deployed in a production environment.
It focuses on comparing the newly trained modelâ€™s performance with the current production
model and deciding whether the newly trained model should be accepted based on its
performance (in this case, F1 score).
